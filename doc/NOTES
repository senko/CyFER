Some implementation notes:

	* RC2 uses effective keylength of 64 bits
	* DESX implementation uses 24-bit keys: K=(K1,K2,K3)
		- K1 is pre-whitening, K3 is post-whitening key
	* RC5 implementation is RC5-32/12/16
	* RC6 implementation is RC6-32/20/16
	* AES (Rijndael) uses 128-bit keys, 128-bit blocks, 10+1 rounds
	* TripleDES is outer EDE
